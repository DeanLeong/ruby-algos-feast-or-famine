## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Feast or Famine"

_Language: Ruby_

_Difficulty Rating: Easy_

### Objectives

- Create a method that takes two parameters as an input, an animal (`beast`) and a food (`dish`), and checks if the first and last letter of the _animal_ match the first and last letter of the _food_.
- If they match, return the first and last letter as a single string.
- If they do not match, return the boolean, `false`.

> i.e.:
>
> input => `"great blue heron", "garlic naan"`
>
> output => `"gn"`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and open a PR when it's done!

### Notes

- All arguments are lowercase.
- All arguments have at least two letters each.

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
