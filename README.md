## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Feast or Famine"

### Objectives
FEAST OR FAMINE
 - Write a method that takes two arguments: an animal and a food, which are lowercase and have at least two letters each
 - If the first and last letter of the animal match the first and last letter of the food, return the first and last letters
 - otherwise, if the letters do not match, return false
> i.e.:
> input => `"great blue heron", "garlic naan"`
> output => `"gn"`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and open a PR when it's done!

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
